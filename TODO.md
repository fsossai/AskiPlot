# TODO

- [ ] GroupedBars
    - [ ] Renamed to BarGrouper?
    - [ ] .Plot --> .Commit
    - [ ] operator() --> add()
    - [ ] No number of groups in ctor
    - [ ] Simplify the use of `GroupedBars`
    - [ ] Add default `Brush` for `GroupedBars`
- [ ] Random brush
- [ ] Named bars
- [ ] Replace `Fusion` with `Fuse` and `FuseCentered` member functions
- [ ] PlotFusion is pointless. A regular Plot method is enough
- [ ] Drawing horizontal and vertical lines given a relative position
- [ ] Simplify all overloads that handle default values
- [ ] Subplots / Views
- [ ] `BarPlot` should have a _value_ and a _name_ for each bar
- [ ] Draw line at an angle
